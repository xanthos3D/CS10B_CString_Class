/* //client code - note namespace std and namespace cs_mystring (should be declared as a block in mystring.h and mystring.cpp)
// download and use mystring_data.txt data file content for Basic Test section of client code
 * -------------------
 * These functions are designed to help you test your MyString objects,
 * as well as show the client usage of the class.
 *
 * The BasicTest function builds an array of strings using various
 * constructor options and prints them out.  It also uses the String
 * stream operations to read some strings from a data file.
 *
 * The RelationTest function checks out the basic relational operations
 * (==, !=, <, etc) on Strings and char *s.
 *
 * The ConcatTest functions checks the overloaded + and += operators that
 * do string concatenation.
 *
 * The CopyTest tries out the copy constructor and assignment operators
 * to make sure they do a true deep copy.
 *
 * Although not exhaustive, these tests will help you to exercise the basic
 * functionality of the class and show you how a client might use it.
 *
 * While you are developing your MyString class, you might find it
 * easier to comment out functions you are ready for, so that you don't
 * get lots of compile/link complaints.
